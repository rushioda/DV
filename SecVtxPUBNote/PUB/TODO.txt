- Harmonize feynman diagrams and add into the note
- Improve description of the models in the PUB note, and add references

- Decide on which plots we want to show, and what models to include on each of the plots
  --> Grouped plots with all models for breakdown of various terms? 
       ---- Stick with current definition of total efficiency
       ---- Need to introduce some truth acceptance into definition. Don't show this.
       ---- Single plots for all three models. Need to still choose which points within each model
  --> In definition of efficiency and split rate, drop the 10mm cut
       ---- Introduce a cut instead on match score? For efficiency >0.5? Study?
  --> Efficiency as a function of number of tracks?
       ---- Separate into algo and total
       ---- Only needed for gg and h->aa
  --> Efficiency as a function of mu
       ---- All models to be included
       ---- Show for algo and total
       ---- Reference LRT note to explain primary mu dep.
  --> Efficiency as a function of opening angle between leptons [HNL only]
       ---- Still needs a bit of study
       ---- Add in hadronic models, using the max dR between any two truth tracks
       ---- Separate into A, algo and total. Decide on which to show once we understand the primary effect of inefficiency
  --> Effect of track attachmen
       ---- Clarify what selection eff is (probably there, I just didn't read it yet)
       ---- Only for gg and haa signatures
       ---- Plot already exists, but decide on which models to show. We think we understand the N1 dep, but confirm?
  --> Mass resolution plots
       ---- Understand peak at 0.05?
       ---- Double check definition of what goes into this plot; clarify into the text
  --> Reproduce truth purity plots with inclusive truth definition
  --> Split rate
       ---- Use inclusive truth vertex definition
       ---- [not directly discussed, but we should include a plot contrasting a->uu and a->bb]
       ---- Drop the 10mm cut, as discused above 
       ---- Look at the dep on match score? Try >0
       ---- Loop at the dep on nTrk from LLP decay. Try with >=1 and >=2. Likely to go with >=2 def


Make productions more centeralized
X Add all samples to Code repoistory
- Re-run all models with new truth classification in a single production
- Add a dedicated script to merge the outputs into DSID output trees
- Add a dedicated script to make each of the plots for the PUB note

-------------------------
----- Haa questions -----
-------------------------
- Add samples
- Understand how the analysis is going to be carried out?
- Decide on which models we want to show? Are you seriously considering taus, or should we focus only on b's?
- Understand truth matching more, and what we want to do? Inclusive?
- Do we want to see if we can resolve the b's?
- Mass resolution? Should be correlated with how the match score looks.
